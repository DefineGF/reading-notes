### Moore's Law for Everything

My work at OpenAI reminds me every day about the magnitude of the socioeconomic change that is coming sooner than most people believe. Software that can think and learn will do more and more of the work that people now do. Even more power will shift from labor to capital. If public policy doesn’t adapt accordingly, most people will end up worse off than they are today.

> 我在OpenAI的工作每天都在提醒我，社会经济变革的规模比大多数人想象的要快。能够思考和学习的软件将会越来越多地完成人们现在所做的工作。更多的权力将从劳动力向资本转移。如果公共政策不做出相应的调整，大多数人最终的境况将比现在更糟。



We need to design a system that embraces this technological future and taxes the assets that will make up most of the value in that world–companies and land–in order to fairly distribute some of the coming wealth. Doing so can make the society of the future much less divisive and enable everyone to participate in its gains.

> 我们需要设计一个系统来拥抱这个技术的未来，并对构成这个世界大部分价值的资产——公司和土地——征税，以便公平地分配一些即将到来的财富。这样做可以使未来社会的分裂性大大减少，并使每个人都能参与其成果。



In the next five years, computer programs that can think will read legal documents and give medical advice. In the next decade, they will do assembly-line work and maybe even become companions. And in the decades after that, they will do almost everything, including making new scientific discoveries that will expand our concept of “everything.”

> 在未来五年内，能够思考的计算机程序将能够阅读法律文件并提供医疗建议。在接下来的十年里，他们将在装配线上工作，甚至可能成为伙伴。在那之后的几十年里，他们将做几乎所有的事情，包括做出新的科学发现，这将扩展我们对“一切”的概念。



This technological revolution is unstoppable. And a recursive loop of innovation, as these smart machines themselves help us make smarter machines, will accelerate the revolution’s pace. Three crucial consequences follow:

> 这场技术革命势不可挡。随着这些智能机器帮助我们制造更智能的机器，创新的递归循环将加速革命的步伐。三个关键的结果随之而来:

- This revolution will create phenomenal wealth. The price of many kinds of labor (which drives the costs of goods and services) will fall toward zero once sufficiently powerful AI “joins the workforce.”

  > 这场革命将创造惊人的财富。一旦足够强大的人工智能“加入劳动力大军”，许多种类的劳动力(推动商品和服务成本)的价格将降至零。

- The world will change so rapidly and drastically that an equally drastic change in policy will be needed to distribute this wealth and enable more people to pursue the life they want.

  > 世界将发生如此迅速而剧烈的变化，因此需要在政策上做出同样剧烈的改变，以分配这些财富，使更多的人能够追求他们想要的生活。

- If we get both of these right, we can improve the standard of living for people more than we ever have before.

  > 如果我们做到这两点，我们就能比以往任何时候都更好地提高人们的生活水平。

Because we are at the beginning of this tectonic shift, we have a rare opportunity to pivot toward the future. That pivot can’t simply address current social and political problems; it must be designed for the radically different society of the near future. Policy plans that don’t account for this imminent transformation will fail for the same reason that the organizing principles of pre-agrarian or feudal societies would fail today.



What follows is a description of what’s coming and a plan for how to navigate this new landscape.
